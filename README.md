**Tic Tac Toe**

One of the first games we learn to play! Enter HTML, CSS  and Javascript; and its not that much fun any more!
Enough to drive you crazy when you actually try to code and style it!!

The app 
* Renders a game board in the browser
* Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
* Visually displays which side has won 
* Allows customization of Player names and Player tokens
* Saves the game and game info of an incomplete game, even when the browser is closed and reopened

Baby Steps
- I started off implementing a basic game which let 2 players play alternately and outputs the winner or a tie 
situation. The input events are stored in variables and then compared with all the winning combinations to determine
the winner.
- Added Reset function.
- The next step was adding some CSS styling. 
- The next step was allowing the Players to customize the tokens.
- Added game counters to keep score over multiple games.
- Used local storage to store and retrieve game info when browser is closed or internet connectivity is lost 
mid-game.

The game does not have AI functionality, doesn't play against the computer. The biggest challenge was that I kept
checking the online game page instead of my local working page and then wondering why it didn't reflect any of the
changes I had made!
